/-!
Writes `Tests/WycheproofVectors.lean` and `Tests/WycheproofKeyVectors.lean` from Project
Wycheproof's own JSON, so that the suite is regenerated rather than kept by hand.

Run it from the `test` directory with the checkout to read from:

    lake env lean --run tools/Wycheproof.lean path/to/wycheproof/testvectors_v1 ES521

The algorithms after the directory are the ones whose groups are left out. This is `jose`'s own
generator with that list taken from the command line rather than fixed in the source, so that this
suite can run the groups that one leaves out.

It reads `Lean.Data.Json`, which the library itself does not: this is a program run by hand over a
trusted file, and it is elaborated by the frontend either way.

This is not part of any target. Nothing in the suite imports it, and it is here so that the two
generated files can be made again when Wycheproof publishes a new version.
